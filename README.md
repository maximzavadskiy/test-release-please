# test-release-please
 - Uses https://github.com/googleapis/release-please to make auto-canary releases
 
 - Currently non-canary releases can be done manually via e.g. `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: release 2.0.0" -m "Release-As: 2.0.0"`
# TODO
 - [ ] Fix tag `release-please-v2.0.0-rc` -> `v2.0.0-rc`
